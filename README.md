## Introduction

MotorGo a two-stage release structure for MotorGo boards:

- Experimental Boards: Boards that are in alpha or beta testing stages. These boards range from first designs to boards that are almost ready for production. The board definitions for these boards are stored in this repository. Follow the instructions below to add these board definitions to your Arduino IDE.

- Production Boards: Boards that are ready for production. The board definitions for these boards are available in the `esp32 by espressif systems` board definition package in the Arduino IDE and PlatformIO. For more information on how to use these board definitions, refer to the [MotorGo Documentation](https://docs.motorgo.net/standalone_mode/board_setup).
